Texas Ðoge'em is the newest form of local online poker. When playing Texas Ðoge'em, all players gather around a single computer screen that displays the environment such as the pot, flop, as well as who's in a game. Each players' game is actually controled from a phone web browser. When a game starts, each player scans a QR code or copy's the link from an in-game display to join in. On mobile, the player has access to their hand, Ðoge Coin balance, and action responses.
